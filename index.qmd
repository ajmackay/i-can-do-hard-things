I'm Aaron. I work as a data analyst primarily using R. I am interested in using data and data story-telling to broaden our understanding of the world. In my spare time I ride my bicycle, practice back flips and make strange electronic music.

This blog is where I post things that I have learned through my data analytics and programming journey as well as other interesting tidbits.
